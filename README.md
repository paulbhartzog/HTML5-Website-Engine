HTML5 Website Engine

Just a nifty little web engine I built using HTML 5, CSS, Sammy.js, jQuery, and a little elbow grease. :-)

The goal was just to have a setup-and-go web engine, for people who don't have the time, energy, or knowledge to code one up for themselves.

Style-wise the pages fade in and out when you change from one page to the next, which is pleasing to the eye.

The engine also includes some debug logging features, and loads all pages dynamically without reloading the site or leaving the initial page. (Single-page design). It also includes an Error page in case anyone requests garbage.
