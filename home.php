Hey there.
</p>
<p>
This website is just a place for me to share a nifty little web engine I built
 using HTML 5, CSS, Sammy.js, jQuery, and a little elbow grease. :-)
</p>
<p>
The goal was just to have a setup-and-go web engine,
 for people who don't have the time, energy, or knowledge
 to code one up for themselves.
</p>
<p>
It includes some debug logging features,
and loads all pages dynamically without
reloading the page or leaving the first page.
(Single-page design).
